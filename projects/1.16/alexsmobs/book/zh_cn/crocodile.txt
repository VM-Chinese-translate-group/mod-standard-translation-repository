The Crocodile is a massive reptile that spawns in rivers and swamps rarely throughout the overworld. This beast lunges towards
 its prey, grabbing and then pulling them underwater, where it proceeds to deal a devastating death roll. It is naturally hostile
 towards man and beast alike.

The Crocodile often comes ashore to bask during the day. At this time it can also lay its eggs. Crocodile eggs can be thrown like
 their distant relative the chicken, and can possibly birth a baby Crocodile. The young monster will be imprint on the closest being,
 and will defend the area of its birth from monsters. Interacting with it can also make it stay still and bask.

 Crocodile Scutes are dropped when the creatures becomes an adult or on death. These scutes can be used to create a protective
 chestplate that increases the wearer's swim speed. They can also be used to make a copy of this book.
