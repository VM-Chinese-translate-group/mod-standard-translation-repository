Cockroaches are the natural prey of Cave Centipedes, which will seek them out from far away. When injured gravely, it is possible for a roach to loose its head, yet it seems they are fully capable of functioning in this beheaded form.
On death, cockroaches have a chance to drop Cockroach Wing Fragments. Nine of these can be used to create a full Cockroach Wing, which in turn can be used to brew a rare potion of Bug Pheromones.
